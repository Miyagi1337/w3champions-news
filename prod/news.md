For anyone experiencing the following problems:
- The W3Champions launcher is showing the error "Could not find Warcraft III executable",
and/or
- W3Champions does not show inside of the Warcraft III client.

Please attempt the following steps:
1. First make sure you follow the steps in the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1aRcUL7qEc
2. If it still doesn't work, make sure the webui folder from the video is copied into the _retail_ folder where your warcraft III folder is installed. (Note: this is NOT the /user/documents/WarcraftIII/ path but rather the /program files/warcraft3 https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/689505160250261659/718533650702139512/unknown.png)
3. If you are still experiencing the first issue, try launching warcraft III normally from battle.net, closing it out, and relaunching the W3Champions launcher.
4. Make sure to try running the W3champions launcher as an administrator.

If after these steps you still have issues, please let us know in #error-reports.
