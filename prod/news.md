Greeting W3Champions,

This announcement serves to explain our plans ahead of season 2.  In brief:

Season 2 schedule;
End Season Tournament;
MMR reset;
FFA and RT MMR tweaks;
Minimum MMR gate for Grandmaster;
Ranking tweaks – decay, minimum number of games, etc; and
New maps

1. Season 2 Schedule:

Season 2 begins Friday, July 17 and will run six weeks.  (July 17 – August 28) Seasons, from now on, will begin and end on a Friday.  This means we will be delaying the end of Season 1 from July 12 until July 17 18:00 CEST.

We received feedback that 8 week season was too long and people were bored of the grind.  We think that was because (1) there was no MMR reset (so felt like continuation of S0, a superlong season); and (2)  no end season tournament, which would give something to play for. We will try 6 weeks this season and poll the community at the end and see what they like better.


2.  End Season Tournament.

There will be an end season tournament. Top 8 from Gradmaster league in each realm will be invited to play.  Winner will be be given S2 Champion flair in their profile.  B2Warcraft will cast the Grandmaster’s tournament.  Grandmaster’s Tournament will be September 4th and 5th, and will have a crowdfunded prizepool from Matcherino.  The money will be split 65/35 in favor of EU. More details on End Season Tournament to be announced during Season 2. There is no region-lock, an Americas realm player may qualify for EU tournament and vice-versa.  The only requirement for qualification is ranking. If an invitee can not participate, the invitation will be extended down the rankings until we have filled a bracket of eight. A player may only participate in ONE of the End Season Tournaments. The W3C team reserves the right to exclude players who cheat, abuse the system, or in other ways display harmful behavior. (If interest is high we may expand End Season Tournament to lower divisions)


3. MMR Reset

W3C plans to institute Race Based MMR in Season 2. Because of that, we will be doing a HARD reset of everyone’s MMR. That means Happy et al will be at 1500 for the start of S2, so noobs beware of ladder for a few days until the pros sort their ranks out.  In later seasons, we will revisit, but currently are thinking of a SOFT reset (details TBD) so that after placement matches everything doesn’t look exactly as it did at the end of previous season.

4.  FFA and RT MMR changes

We have received feedback for matchmaking, ranking, and MMR calculation for both of these game types and are working to improve the experience. For FFA, we will be switching to Ugri’s FFA formula:  Winner wins a solo vs top opponent.  Losers lose a solo vs winner divided by number of opponents.  RT tweak is TBD.

5. Minimum MMR to reach Grandmaster

Before the beginning of a new season, W3C admin will set a minimum MMR that will be required to place you into grandmaster.  This will make a very exciting race to see who can be the first to meet that threshold and place in the highest division.  It also means no more “hilarious” 0-5 lightning quick placements to claim your 3 seconds as a grandmaster.

6. Ranking tweaks

Decay is present, but it is not working as intended.  We will be working on decay so that it better incentivizes grinding and playing games. As per earlier stated philosophy, decay will not affect MMR, because we don’t want to hurt the quality of matchmaking. As Ranking Points is the only other metric, that is where we will do our tweaking.  As you can not fall out of your league due to RP (because league is MMR based), you, in theory, can only fall to the bottom of your league with decay.  However, the hope is that as other players from lesser divisions continue to play, they will gain the MMR required to surpass you and kick your inactive self out of the ladder.  We are also considering a minimum number of games needed to be invited to the End Season Tournament and/or be displayed on the End Season rankings.

7. New maps

We polled the community and found that the large majority were in favor of new maps.  A plurality wanted 2 maps, but it was close enough to 1 and 3, that we felt we could get as close as possible to pleasing everyone (3 mappers, 2 mappers, 1 mappers, and no mappers), by just adding 1.  Community voted in #surveys and overwhelmingly voted for Autumn Leaves (https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/autumn-leaves.325395/ Should be noted, that mapmaker is making slight changes to map for release of S2). In later seasons we will likely add more maps and more vetoes.  Please post your ideas for good new maps in #suggestions, with arguments as to why they are good, and links to the map.

We appreciate the community’s feedback, and used it to help inform our decisions about what to change in Season 2.  As always, please keep the advice coming our way in #suggestions.  See you on the battlefield on July 17, and in twitch chat for End Season Tournament the first weekend of September!!!  Thanks and have fun!!!
