Greeting W3Champions,

WC3 just released the ability to zoom-out for w3champions. Everyone will be required to download the new installer (windows or mac) from our website to pick up these changes.  You will also need to restart Warcraft III.

Standard zoom - 1650
Max zoom - 3000

Type "-zoom XXXX" to set desired zoom.
Type "-zoom" to return to standard

All game modes EXCEPT FFA will support zooming out. We'll be working on adding zoom-out to FFA next. Observers cannot use the zoom-out functionality yet either. We are still researching how to support observers. Please report any issues to us here in discord. 

When you play your next match, you should see a message that will show you how to zoom out ingame. Your zoom preferences will persist to future matches automatically.

Join bugs are caused by different map paths. 
If you have a Maps folder inside your Warcraft 3 directory go ahead and delete it.
Delete Path-to-game/Maps Path-to-game/_retail_/maps

Example:
DELETE C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\Maps
DELETE C:\Program Files (x86)\Warcraft III\_retail_\Maps

The correct folders for maps are:
1) Windows -> Documents\Warcraft III\Maps <--- here you should have a folder W3Champions with w3c maps
2) Mac -> Library/Application Support/Blizzard/Warcraft III/Maps <--- here you should have a folder W3Champions with w3c map
